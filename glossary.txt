Predator 
**Aspects**
*Living Workshop*
	Your own wreck-salvaged body contains an array of useful tools - your presence gives an automatic advantage on rolls taken to create temporary gear and machinery to all crewmates.

*You Make Your Own Path*
	Whenever you would receive a chart you may convert it to a piece of salvage and a whisper instead. Once per scene, treat a conflict as a triumph when rolling without the benefit of a skill.

*Manifold Bow*
	Finely-crafted bow paired with an expansive quiver. Can deal LR damage of three types chosen from the following list: Spike, Toxin, Blast, Volt, Salt.

*Butchery Kit*
	You can butcher dangerous specimens without risk or cutting for difficulty, and increase impact when gathering resources from a creature you've hunted.

Jehlo
**Aspects**
*Voltaic Mantle*
	The tendrils of your mantle crackle with lightning as they strike, dealing CQ volt damage.

*Deeps-Badger Claws*
	Used by their original owners to carve out places of safety amongst the lower regions of the waves. Deals CQ Keen damage, and you can use a task to lower the effective Pressure level of your immediate surroundings by one.

*Howl of the Veil*
	The echo of this terrible call in your mind dulls natural fear responses. Seeing leviathans and other bestial horrors offers whispers instead of mire.

*Pressure Suit*
	A clanking pressure-suit designed to allow its user to explore the depths.
==========
Nox
**Aspects**
*Iris Blossom*
	You can see heat the way others see colour.

*Ritual Mask*
	You can clearly see spirits and the spectral realm.

*Inscribed Root*
	Mark to reshape nearby exposed wood into a useful obstacle. Mark mire to reshape nearby exposed wood into a winding path.

*Stone-Bound Histories*
	A tattered tome of ancient stories handed down by the eldest ektus survivors of the pre-verdant days. Use a task to gain a sliver of Pre-V information.

Impact
**Low Impact**
Your action is weaker, having less effect on the world.
This might reduce the number of boxes you mark or clear
when affecting a track, or downgrade the raw power of
whatever you’re attempting (such as only letting you
kick a panel out of a door rather than kick the door
fully open).

**Normal Impact**
Most actions you take throughout the game will have
normal impact, with no special rules to follow at all.

**High Impact**
Your action is stronger and has more effect on the world .
This normally lets you mark or clear an additional box
when affecting a track, but in some circumstances might
upgrade the raw power of whatever you’re attempting
(such as letting you kick a door off of its hinges rather
than just kick it open).

**Massive Impact**
Usually reserved for damage from ship-mounted
armaments, an action with massive impact is terrifyingly
potent. If you’re marking a track, mark every box (and
if you're kicking a door open you might take part of the
wall with it as well, even if you didn't mean to).
